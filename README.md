- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cyberbellator
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all kinds of programming, but I mostly program for my FTC team 20726 Tobor the Viking.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about programming and different applications like game design, robots, and more
- âš¡ Fun fact: I taught myself Java
